				PROJECT IDEATION

Ideas:-

- Application can be made as a console application, which will be simpler and faster.
- Since, prices are based on timelines and they change everytime according to various factors, Time series analysis can be used.
- Datasets can be acquired from Kaggle.
- Models that can be used,
    Linear regression
    Polynomical regression
    Bayesian linear regression
    Logistic regression
    Lasso regression
- Linear regression can be a simpler choice as it can yield a good result faster.
- But as the result will be based on various factors, it is better to use polynomial regression.
- To further expand the uses of this application, the application can be made as a web application.
- The acquired results can be stored at the backend for reviewing the past variations in the prices of the crude oil.
- MySQL can be used for storing the data.
- As these datas can be very large and doesnt have a fixed structure, the ideal solution is to go for document DB's such as MongoDB.
- Google Colab can be used for developing the regression model.
- Data abtraction and encapsulation should be followed , so if in case the application need to be scaled to a larger one, it'll be easier to develop the new modules.

Key points:-

- Since, prices are based on timelines and they change everytime according to various factors, Time series analysis can be used.
- But as the result will be based on various factors, it is better to use polynomial regression.
- Application should be abstract.
